<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">Speech Emotion Perception in Depression</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px;">
    1. We want to explore if subclinical population perceives emotion of an audio differently than healthy population.<br>
    2. Subclinical population means participants who have self-reported depression through a series of tests - like PHQ9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), GAD7 (General Anxiety Disorder), PSS4 (Perceived Stress Scale).<br>
    3. We have collected our own data for this experiment from around 100 participants-all college students so basically this test was for young population (18-25 yrs of age group). 
    4. We designed the experiment on a React based software - Labvanced and conducted the survey in a noise proof room with a system and a headphone.

In the `Data Analysis` Folder 
I have n `.ipynb` files which have the detailed analysis I have done on the collected data


In the `Reviews` folder I have put the literature review of paper related to the project idea and any possible continuation of this project.

The combined dataset is in this link [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_4NwibBrKdoR2oH8g5SPzXTxTBRVNg2DRbrac8FP7Pk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
1. Sheet one is stimuli wise data
2. Sheet 2 is participant wise data (All sets combined), excluding the familial history
3. Rest of the 4 sheets are setwise complete data

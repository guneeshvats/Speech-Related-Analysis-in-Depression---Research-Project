<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">Version 1 : Speech Emotion Perception in Depression</h3>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px;">
    1. We want to explore if subclinical population perceives emotion of an audio differently than healthy population.<br>
    2. Subclinical population means participants who have self-reported depression through a series of tests - like PHQ9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), GAD7 (General Anxiety Disorder), PSS4 (Perceived Stress Scale).<br>
    3. We have collected our own data for this experiment - 97 participants-all college students ebcause this test was targetted for young population (18-25 yrs of age group). 
    4. We designed the experiment on a React based software - Labvanced and conducted the survey in a noise proof room with a system and a headphone.

The draft submitted in Interspeech is named `Version 5_submission.pdf` got rejected in 2023. The Latex, Overleaf Zip folder is also uploaded - `Interspeech_submission_2023_V5.zip`
The draft submitted in OCOCOSDA got accepted in 2024 on different population but similar design named `IIITSaint_EmoMDB_2024.pdf`


<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">Version 2 : Speech Emotion Perception in Depression & Production Combined</h3>

In Version 2 of the study, we have made a lot of changes. Identified problems due to which we didn't get good results from previous data and also made a plan to execute this study with Clinical MDD patients and also with subclinical population.
